  ## Feature list
  * denotes on my to do for the project
  3 days = 30 hours
  My plan is to have an interactive note taking/to do list app inspired by Google Keep which I use daily. I like to implement the features I've kept from the list we created as a class below and I believe it'd take me roughly 30 hours to complete all the necessary features. My end goal is to practice the skills we've learned here at HREXT and showcase my skills as well as deliver a clean product that delivers on its functionality.
